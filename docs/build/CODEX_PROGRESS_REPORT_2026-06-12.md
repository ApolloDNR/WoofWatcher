# Codex Progress Report - 2026-06-12

## Current Status

WoofWatcher is mid-upgrade toward v1.5 Premium Neo-Retro Pixel Care.

## Completed In This Pass

- Confirmed the repo source-of-truth docs and current CI state.
- Repaired the mobile v1.5 navigation CI regression by normalizing Home quick-log potty handling.
- Preserved the mobile bottom nav contract: Home, Log, Plans, Health, More.
- Added the v1.5 source docs requested by Apollo.
- Recorded the PWA/dashboard upgrade direction without demoting the canonical mobile app.
- Implemented the PWA v1.5 shell foundation: grouped desktop sidebar, five-item mobile bottom nav, top-bar search/reminder/date/profile/theme controls, persisted light/dark theme, grouped Quick Log v2, PWA product-view-model navigation groups, and localStorage-preserved meal/potty lifecycle fields.
- Added a PWA readiness test for v1.5 navigation, Potty parent quick log, and meal served-to-outcome lifecycle.
- Implemented the first Phoenix Home v1.5 workflow upgrade: a Phoenix Status card that answers presence, alone state, mood, next care, and open meal outcome state. Open meals can now be updated from Home with one tap.
- Implemented the Quick Log v2 detail-flow skeleton in the PWA: Meal now opens a served-to-outcome workflow with portion, food, caregiver, pending outcome, and update outcome fields; Potty now opens a parent/outcome workflow for location, pee/poop/both/tried/accident, caregiver, and notes. Other quick actions still save immediately.
- Implemented Household Pulse as a first-class PWA route with manual Leaving Home and I'm Home flows. Leaving Home starts an open household-visible alone timer; returning home closes it with outcome, duration, caregiver, recovery, and note context. The More screen now has a directory entry point back into Household Pulse and other secondary tools.
- Implemented scoped PWA Care Pass export cards for Vet, Sitter, Trainer, and Emergency audiences. Each card now uses the shared `buildScopedCarePass` source, exposes a copyable text payload, and downloads structured JSON for later premium PDF/server-backed report generation.
- Implemented Diet & Treats as a first-class PWA route. The screen now shows current food, daily meal target/progress, meals today, treats today, hydration context, avoid/sensitivity chips, diet profile editing, and direct actions to Log Meal, Log Treat, or edit the profile.
- Implemented WoofGuide as a first-class PWA route with owner-reviewed action cards. Actions now route into Meal Log, Care Pass review, Records review, and a bounded vet-note draft while keeping live OpenAI optional and clearly separated.
- Split PWA Timeline, Records, Reports, and Care Pass into directly routable desktop/sidebar work surfaces instead of collapsing them into More.
- Implemented Avatar Studio as a first-class PWA prototype route with local reference photo upload memory, selectable Phoenix template state, and the required future animation state inventory.
- Implemented Achievements as a first-class PWA route backed by `getAchievementReview`. The route derives meaningful milestones from real care evidence: routine streak, training consistency, happy tummy week, bedtime snack proof, calm alone time, and records completeness.

## Verification

- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the CI repair: 178 passing tests.
- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the PWA shell slice: 181 passing tests.
- Phoenix Home open meal workflow verification is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Quick Log v2 meal/potty flow verification is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the Quick Log v2 flow slice: 183 passing tests.
- Household Pulse manual alone-time workflow verification is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the Household Pulse slice: 184 passing tests.
- Scoped Care Pass audience export wiring is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the scoped Care Pass export slice: 185 passing tests.
- Diet & Treats route wiring is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the Diet & Treats route slice: 186 passing tests.
- WoofGuide owner-reviewed action routing is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Timeline/Records/Reports/Care Pass direct routing is covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Avatar Studio prototype route and state inventory are covered by the PWA readiness test.
- Achievements direct routing is covered by the PWA readiness test, and achievement derivation is covered by `woof-achievements.test.js`.
- Focused behavior tests passed locally after the Achievements route slice: 191 passing tests.
- JS syntax checks passed for `artifacts/woofwatcher/src/vanilla/app-entry.js`, `artifacts/woofwatcher/src/vanilla/woof-core.js`, and `artifacts/woofwatcher/src/vanilla/woof-product-view-model.js`.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Local TypeScript could not run because this checkout did not have `node_modules/typescript`.
- GitHub Actions full verification is the authoritative full typecheck/build gate after push.

## Current Implementation Focus

Next implementation slice:

1. Phoenix Home v1.5 polish: stronger household pulse mini-card and Health/Bile snapshot.
2. Settings route and export/import/safety consolidation.
3. Runtime/browser visual QA once a local package manager or dev server dependency install is available.
4. Fable/Replit-facing visual handoff notes for the shipped PWA routes.

## Known Limitations

- Final pixel animation assets are not present.
- Browser screenshot verification was not possible in this checkout because `node_modules`, `pnpm`, `npm`, and the local app terminal helper were unavailable.
- Real AI, cloud sync, provider-backed roles, push notifications, payments, document storage, binary PDFs, and app-store release remain separate production slices.
